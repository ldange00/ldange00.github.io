# Website

Just a simple page to introduce myself as a computer enthusiast!

## Abstract

The website will grow with me, and my skills, introducing:</br>
responsive design, framework, backend management and much more
(something I'll invent).

## Conclusion

I like to explore, learn and deepen... in short,
*knowing how to manage what intrigues me* and, also,
to propose my theories, ideas and solutions.</br>
This repo will also want to be a guide to my method,
which will evolve over the years.
